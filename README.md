    - Docker
  - Commands
    > docker compose up -d

# Bootcamp - Backend

Now you understand (at least a little) Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. All of these pieces work together to make up the stable, scalable, and maintainable web application development stack that we use at 10KC.

# Your Challenge

- Create a simple photo sharing application backend using all of the frameworks and tools you just learned. The backend API must:
  - Support adding and deleting photos
  - Fetch all photos for a user.
  - Allow users to post publicly or privately.
  - Store any uploaded images in MongoDB (MongoDB provides access to a free database) - Allow comments on the photos by authenticated users.
  - The server should be written using Node.js and Express.js
  - The database should be built with MongoDB and Mongoose
  - Use Git for source control on a public repository (ideally GitHub)
- The backend must demonstrate the following:
  - User authentication and authorization protected routes
  - Response pagination
  - Request validation
  - Unit testing with Jest should be demonstrated (code coverage does not need to be 100%, just enough to show understanding)

# Submission

The source code for the photo sharing API should be shared with the team at 10KC once it is completed.
